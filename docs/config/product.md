## Add Variant

* In your Shopify `Admin` go to `Products` => `All Products`
* Edit your product or create one
* At the bottom of the product page you will see a section named `Variants`
* Check the check case (if your product has variants)
* You can now add options

E.g.
  > You sell t-shirt in different size (xs, s, m, l) and color (red, orange, green)
