# Good to know about shopify

- Not suited for brands that wish to have special offers
- Nothing is native, everything is eitehr custom or app
- Most features have a cost, all the modules have year/month plans.
- Either you buy them, either you dev them (highly expensive) 
- You need to have activated the shopify account in order to use apps like transporter, script editor and other
- No shopify assistance unless the websote is already activated
- Checkout custom : only possible once shopify + is installed
- Rigid checkout : the checkout is not customizable easily, you must apply heavy overrides to it
- Script Editor : App free on Shopify + lets you code special offers. But the client is not able to edit them if he doens not know about coding
- Products : Limited number of variables, if needed to add more yu have to go through apps (like custom fields). 
- Customers cannot edit their own personal info, to do this you have either to dev a custom app or use an existing app do to so. 
- Customer info : no possibility of adding specific fields (like date of birth), only possible via third party apps (like custom fields) 
- Email notifications : Native Emails (notifications) are not translatable 
- No possiblity of addign cc recipents on email notifications
- Back end product interface needs to be improved (pagination, number of products is not displayed, cannot choose the variables of the main product table for filtering... no config available) 
- No native filter system

## Not suited for : 
- Complex websites or brands that might need specific promo offers, special gift card systems
- Multilingual websites : native multilingual shopify system is based on hard coded non evolving catalogs and contents. In order to translate the website you might need an app (Weglot, Languify...)
